Goals, Projects, Community, Membership at Softreck Company OSS Projects

## Why Softreck Company Foundation?

We were designed from the start as an independent forum to foster open development and collaboration across open source
technologies for Softreck.

## Goals Softreck Company Foundation

Our goal is to strengthen the Softreck ecosystem through openness, rapid innovation, and community participation.
Softreck Company was created at 2019.01

Softreck Foundation is bigger than just Softreck Company 
and we want to see the platform survive for another 2 years – in the open.
We want to collaborate with industry partners that will innovate with the community.

## Support on Open Source Projects

We do this by supporting Softreck Fonudation Open Source Projects backed by corporate sponsors and individuals alike. 
We help projects stay focused on producing high-quality software without the legal and administrative distractions 
and overhead so they can focus on helping contributors and writing code.

## Our Projects



## Why not encourage Softreck Open Source Projects to join other foundations?

We certainly don't discourage it! Absolutely feel free to join any foundation you prefer. We will even happily
facilitate those connections when we can. We are special in that we're the only foundation to focus exclusively on
Softreck. That means we can keep our focus narrow, and that our community shares the same skills, tools, and
environments-so it's a good filter to know what you're getting.

## What license will Softreck Foundation projects use?

The Softreck Foundation is license-agnostic. Projects that come to the Foundation are free to choose any open source
license, as defined by the Open Source Initiative. However, we do NOT believe that making software available under an
open source license is sufficient. We expect our projects to accept contributions from the community where they clearly
align with the project strategy.

## How are Softreck Foundation projects governed?

It's incredibly important to have a clear governance model that describes how individuals and organizations can engage
with a project. This ensures transparency, which is fundamental to our beliefs. The Softreck Foundation does not
prescribe a governance model for projects. However, we do work with project leads to ensure that they define and
document an optimal model that matches the community's objectives.

## Will the Foundation influence which projects are accepted?

All Softreck Foundation projects are expected to contribute to the Softreck ecosystem in some direct way. When
evaluating project acceptance, we require that the project be directly related to Softreck. 
We also look at the
community health of the project to make sure it aligns to the Softreck Foundation’s values
and [Code of Conduct](https://coc.softreck.dev).
